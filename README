==Depot App

This app is the product of the tutorial in "Agile Web Development with Rails (Fourth Edition)" by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson.

Tanner Welsh is responsible for writing the code within, and all of the inconsistencies it may have. This was my first effort at building a Rails app, so it is quite rusty.
